//     public static Object entry(java.util.List<Object> args)
//
// answering with a value or throwing to refuse. It is called through reflection rather than named
// directly, so that a subject which failed to compile, or compiled under another name, produces a
// sentence on stderr instead of a linkage error out of the class loader.
//
// The JSON reader and writer at the bottom of the file are here because the standard library has no
// JSON and these run in an offline container where a dependency cannot be fetched. They are a real
// recursive-descent parser and a real serialiser: a subject's arguments include nested arrays and
// strings with escapes in them, and anything built out of splitting on commas would mangle those
// quietly, which is the worst way for a harness to be wrong.
